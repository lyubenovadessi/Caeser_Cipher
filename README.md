# 🔐 Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and most famous encryption techniques.  
This Python script allows you to **encode** and **decode** messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a chosen amount.

## 🧠 What is the Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 3:
plain text : hello
cipher text: khoor
## 🚀 Features

- Encode and decode messages
- Automatically handles invalid inputs
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation)
- User-friendly console interface
